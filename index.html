    Hello, I am Don Ngo, a computer science and mathematics major. I am excited to present my submission for the Odin Project's odin-recipes HTML and CSS project. This project showcases my skills in front-end web development and my ability to create a responsive and visually appealing website. By designing and implementing a user-friendly interface, I have successfully created a platform that allows users to explore a variety of sandwich recipes, including classics like ham sandwich, bologna sandwich, and chicken sandwich. Through this project, I have honed my HTML and CSS skills, learned about structuring web pages, and gained experience in creating engaging user interfaces. I hope you enjoy exploring the Odin Recipes website as much as I enjoyed building it!
